# 3-Axis Metal Cutting CNC Machine

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **3-Axis Metal Cutting CNC Machine**, designed to automate precise cutting and shaping of metal components. The system controls the **X, Y, and Z axes** to perform milling, engraving, or cutting operations with high accuracy, reducing manual labor and human error.

## Features
- **Three-Axis Control:** Accurate motion along X, Y, and Z axes.  
- **CNC Automation:** Uses Arduino programming or G-code to control movements.  
- **Metal Cutting:** Capable of cutting soft to medium-hard metals (aluminum, brass, copper, mild steel).  
- **Safety Mechanisms:** Includes limit switches and emergency stop for safe operation.  
- **Repeatability:** Ensures precise and consistent machining results.

## Components
- Arduino UNO microcontroller  
- Stepper motors with drivers  
- Linear guide rails and ball screws  
- Spindle motor for metal cutting  
- Power supply and control electronics  
- Limit switches and emergency stop system  
- Rigid frame and mechanical structure

## Working Principle
1. **X-Axis (Horizontal Movement):** Moves the cutting tool left-right across the workpiece.  
2. **Y-Axis (Depth Movement):** Moves the tool forward-backward.  
3. **Z-Axis (Vertical Movement):** Raises and lowers the tool for engagement with the material.  

The movements are controlled via stepper/servo motors using Arduino. The programmed instructions define tool paths, speed, and cutting depth, enabling precise automated metal machining.

## Applications
- Fabrication of industrial metal components  
- Prototype development and engineering projects  
- Small-scale production of metal parts  
- Educational and research purposes in CNC automation  

## Conclusion
The 3-Axis Metal Cutting CNC Machine integrates **mechanical engineering, electronics, and programming** to perform automated, high-precision metal machining. It’s suitable for industrial, educational, and prototyping applications, providing a platform for learning CNC and embedded control systems.
